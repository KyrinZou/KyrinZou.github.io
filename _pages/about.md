Hello! I'm Haolin, a 5th year PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. I am fortunately advised by Dr. [Arian Maleki](https://sites.google.com/site/malekiarian/?authuser=1) and Prof. [Victor de la Pe単a](https://www.columbia.edu/~vhd1/). Before my doctoral study, I received a Master in Actuarial Science from Columbia University in 2020. I received my Bachelor in Applied Mathematics from Peking University in 2018.

My Research Interests
======
I have a broad interest in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and artificial intellegence, with a primary focus on proportional high dimensional asymptotics. My current research foci include:
1. Risk estimation and cross validation methods,
2. Machine unlearning,
3. Data evaluation and interpretability
